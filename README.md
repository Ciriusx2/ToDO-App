# ToDO-App
This project is a simple yet efficient Todo application built using React. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, updating, deleting, and marking them as completed. The app stores all tasks in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the list is preserved even after the page is refreshed.
